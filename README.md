# Free Code Camp API Project - Timestamp Microservice

The Timestamp Microservice API will take the first parameter/string and determine if it's a date.  If so, the API will return contents like so:

{"unix":1435017600,"natural":"June 23, 2015"}

This is a challenge for [Free Code Camp] (http://freecodecamp.com) that can be found here:

[http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/timestamp-microservice]

Their version of the API is up and running at this URL: [https://timestamp-ms.herokuapp.com/].

My version of the API is up and running at this URL: [https://mysterious-reef-70509.herokuapp.com/],

To use this API - enter something like this:

>[https://mysterious-reef-70509.herokuapp.com/1435017600]

or

>[https://mysterious-reef-70509.herokuapp.com/June 23, 2015] 

You should get the results above/below.
